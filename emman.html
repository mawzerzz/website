            <h2>Challenges in My College Journey</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I’ve encountered in my college journey is the shift from my senior high school course to my current program.
                Back in senior high, I took the STEM track, which focused on subjects like science and math.
                Now, in college, I’m pursuing a degree in BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology), a field that is quite different from what I was used to.
                The transition hasn’t been easy, as I had to adjust to new concepts like programming, networks, and system analysis that weren’t really part of my STEM curriculum.
                It sometimes feels like I’m starting from scratch, and there are moments when I feel overwhelmed by the technicalities of my new course. But through it all, I’ve learned to be more patient with myself, realizing that this challenge is just part of my growth and that I have the ability to adapt, even when things feel unfamiliar.</p>

            <h2>Contribution</h2>
            <p>I focused on styling the project using CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive design.
                A cohesive color scheme featuring FEU Roosevelt’s signature green and gold was applied throughout the site.
                I styled the hero-section with a gradient background and text shadow to enhance its appeal.
                Hover effects were added to buttons, navigation links, and gallery images to improve interactivity.
                Features like the progress-bar and a custom preloader animation elevated the user experience.
                The CSS was thoroughly tested for responsiveness, ensuring seamless display across all screen sizes and devices.</p>
